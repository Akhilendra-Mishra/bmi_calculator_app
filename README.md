## Getting Started

About App:
Developed a cross-platform Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator application using Flutter. This application allows users to input their weight and height to calculate their BMI and determine if they are underweight, healthy, or overweight. The app dynamically updates its background color based on the BMI result to visually indicate the user's health status.

Key Features:

1. User Inputs:
      Weight input in kilograms.
      Height input in feet and inches.

2. BMI Calculation:
      Converts height from feet and inches to centimeters and meters.
      Calculates BMI using the standard formula: 

      BMI = weight/(height)(height)
   
3. Background color changes based on the BMI result:
     Red for overweight.
     Orange for underweight.
     Green for healthy weight.

4. Technologies Used:

   Flutter & Dart: Utilized Flutter for cross-platform development, ensuring smooth performance and a native look and feel on both Android and iOS devices.
   State Management: Managed state using Flutter's StatefulWidget to dynamically update UI elements.
